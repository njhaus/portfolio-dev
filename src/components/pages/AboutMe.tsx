        <span className="bold">Welcome! I'm Nick Haus, Web Developer.</span> I
        am a full-stack web developer with a passion for creating beautiful,
        dynamic, and accessible web applications. I am eager to leverage my technical expertise and collaborative
        skills to contribute to a forward-thinking company at the forefront of
        innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        My web development journey encompasses comprehensive training in front
        and back-end technologies, including, but not limited to, MERN Stack
        technology, SQL, Python, RESTful APIs, and front-end languages such as
        TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have a high aptitude for
        self-starting and self-directed learning, and have become adept at using
        available resources such as technical documentation to achieve my goals.
        Currently, I am participating in Chingu Cohorts, a program in which
        teams of developers gain real-world experinece by developing
        applications using Agile methodology.

      <p>
        Having spent 12 years as a professional in the education field, I have
        honed invaluable skills that transcend industries. As an educator, I
        worked at the forefront of educational technology, piloting educational
        platforms and devices and initiating programs that encouraged students
        to explore the world of tech. In transitioning to Web development, I
        hope to continue to work with professional teams, produce inspiring and
        technically-sound creations, and influence the world.
