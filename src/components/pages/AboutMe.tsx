        <span className="bold">Welcome! I'm Nick Haus, Web Developer.</span> I
        am a full-stack web developer with a passion for creating beautiful,
        dynamic, and accessible web applications. Along with my technical
        skills, I am also a proven team player and lifelong learner with
        excellent customer service, teamwork, and organization skills. I am
        looking to join a modern, innovative company with a forward-thinking,
        outward focus.

        My web development journey encompasses comprehensive training in front
        and back-end technologies, including, but not limited to, MERN Stack
        technology, SQL, Python, RESTful APIs and CRUD operations, Typescript,
        Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I excel in self-directed learning, and have
        become adept at using available resources such as technical
        documentation to achieve my goals. Currently, I am participating in
        Chingu Cohorts, a program in which teams of developers gain real-world
        experience by developing applications using Agile methodology.

        Having spent 12 years as a professional in the education field, I have
        put into practice the personal skills and competencies necessary to
        thrive in a fast-paced, ever-changing professional environment. As an
        educator, I worked at the forefront of educational technology, piloting
        educational platforms and devices and initiating programs that
        encouraged students to explore the world of tech. In transitioning to
        web development, I hope to continue to work with professional teams,
        produce inspiring and technically-sound creations, and influence the
        world.
